I'll implement basically all of these in Python because it's an extremely good functional language for doing number and math work like this.

Some of these are not commented because I felt the implementation was fairly trivial.  Others are commented if I feel the algorithm
or formula used is a little esoteric or I want a reminder when I look at it later on.
